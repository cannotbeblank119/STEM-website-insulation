    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p><strong>Aim:</strong> To experiment on the insulation of five cup materials by measuring which retains heat the longest.</p>
        <p><strong>Background Information:</strong> Insulation slows down the transfer of heat by trapping air in small pockets, reducing heat loss.</p>
        <p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> The Styrofoam cup will keep the water warm the longest due to its insulating properties.</p>

    <section id="method">
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare five cups (paper, plastic, glass, Styrofoam, ceramic) and cover them with foil.</li>
            <li>Use a funnel to make a hole for pouring water and inserting a thermometer.</li>
            <li>Boil 100 ml of water using a kettle.</li>
            <li>Pour water into each cup, insert thermometers, and begin timing from 70°C.</li>
            <li>Record the time taken for each to cool to 39°C.</li>
        </ol>

    <section id="analysis">
        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <p>We found out that our hypothesis was correct because we hypothesized that the styrofoam cup would keep the water hot the longest, and it did so with a time of 46 minutes, 23 seconds, and 09 milliseconds, 2 minutes ahead of the second best, which was paper with a time of 44 minutes, 04 seconds, and 03 milliseconds. We were surprised, however, at the paper cup being in second place,  and the ceramic cup being in last place, because we predicted that since the paper cup was the thinnest out of all the cups, tied with plastic, the amount of heat loss would be greater than the thickest ceramic cup. After some research, we found out that this was because ceramic, while thick, is a better heat conductor than paper or styrofoam, which meant the heat escaped quicker.</p>

    <section id="evaluation">
        <h2>Evaluation</h2>
        <p>Our main setback was that while we accounted for the room temperature, we didn’t think the amount of heat loss through the opening of the cup would be such a big factor in the experiment. Another setback was that we had about 1 hour to conduct the experiment, and we didn’t imagine it could take more than 30 minutes, leading us to change the duration standard from the original standard of 75 degrees - 29 degrees to 65 degrees - 39 degrees. If we were to do this experiment again, we would try to make the experiment more accurate by measuring and applying the same amount of aluminum foil for each cup material. This is because we didn’t accurately measure how much aluminum foil acted as the lid of the cups, which could have altered our test results by acting as a worse or better insulator. The only reason we didn’t do the experiment again by fixing this mistake was the lack of time to finish the whole project.</p>
